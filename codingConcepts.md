## The WHY of Coding (Katie '23)

This OPTIONAL video will go into a little more detail as to what and why we're doing. It's not necessary for the actual coding part, but will give you a little background on what coding can be used for, what code we're using, and the purpose of learning code. Disregard the part that says "copy code into editor" since you won't be coding in this video.
