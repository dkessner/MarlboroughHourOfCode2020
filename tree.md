Happy Holidays!

```javascript
{% include_relative tree.js %}
```

Try changing around the colors and shape of the tree. Maybe add some square shaped decorations?!
You could even add transparency (you can learn this in some other tutorials)!
What about making the tree animated? The bells could change color!
Have fun!
