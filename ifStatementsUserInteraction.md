Here's the tutorial!

<div class="center">
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2j_7bsOyvOw" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

This is what the completed code will look like.
Tip: click the box where the drawing shows up, and use the arrow keys and spacebar!
Watch the video to find out how to make the circle move with your mouse, too.

<div id="preview"></div>

```javascript
{% include_relative ifStatementsUserInteraction.js %}
