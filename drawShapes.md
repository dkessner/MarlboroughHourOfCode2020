## Drawing With Shapes

Video Example

<div class="center">
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DxN5uIEsoGE" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

Here's what your code will look like!

<div id="preview"></div>

Copy this code below to try it yourself!

```javascript
{% include_relative intro.js %}
```
You can put code here instead of going to the website, if you want!

<script src="intro.js"></script>
