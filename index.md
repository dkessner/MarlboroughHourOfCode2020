Welcome! Thanks for being here! This website will walk you through a number of different coding tutorials and projects. It is designed for those with zero experience and also those who have a moderate amount of coding experience. If you are completely new to coding, start with "Coding Concepts" or "Color and the Coordinate Plane". Otherwise, try out making a Click Ball game, or test out Recursion! All tutorials on this site were made by students, for students. Have fun!
